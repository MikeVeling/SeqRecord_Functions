# SeqRecord-Functions
This repository contains my own functions built on top of SeqRecord objects. These functions allow for easy manipulation of these objects within python. These objects can be easily imported and exported from the standard GenBank file format for annotated sequences. This format is widely used by synthetic biologists for gene design and manipulation and integrates nicely into standard visualization tools like SnapGene and Benchling.
